Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon(berrry) tree, which was on the
banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife....
One day crocodile came on the banks of a  river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted
moneky offered his some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day for more 
fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by, crocodile n monkey became good friends forever.
they will die
